The main objective of the project is to design a smart dustbin which will help in keeping our environment clean and
also Eco friendly. We are inspired from “Swaach Bharat Mission”. Nowadays technologies are getting smarter day-by-day so, as to
clean the environment we are designing a smart dustbin by using Arduino. This smart dustbin management system is built on the
microcontroller based system having ultrasonic sensors on the dustbin. If dustbin is not maintained than these can cause an unhealthy
environment and can cause pollute that affect our health. In this proposed technology we have designed a smart dustbin using
ARDUINO UNO, along with ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and battery jumper wire. After all hardware and software connection, now
Smart Dustbin program will be run. Dustbin lid will when someone comes near at some range than wait for user to put garbage
and close it. It’s properly running or not. For social it will help toward health and hygiene, for business for we try to make it
affordable to many as many possible. So that normal people to rich people can take benefit from it.
