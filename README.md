# Smart-dustbin-using-arduino
The smart dust bin, powered by Arduino, is equipped with sensors to identify objects in close proximity. A signal is then transmitted to a servo motor, which unhinges the lid. The motor is programmed to shut the lid after a certain duration.

## Project Overview
The Smart Dustbin project is a part of the Swachh Bharat Mission, aiming to create an eco-friendly and smart waste management system. This project leverages Arduino technology and ultrasonic sensors to automate the opening and closing of a dustbin's lid when a user approaches, promoting responsible waste disposal and a cleaner environment.

## Components and Features
- Arduino Uno: The central microcontroller.
- Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect user presence and garbage.
- Servo Motor: Controls the dustbin lid.
- Battery Jumper Wire: Enables portable operation.

## How It Works
1. When a user approaches the dustbin within a certain range, the ultrasonic sensors detect their presence.
2. The Arduino Uno processes sensor data and activates the servo motor, opening the dustbin lid.
3. After garbage disposal, the dustbin lid closes automatically, promoting cleanliness and responsible waste disposal.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
- Arduino Uno board
- Ultrasonic sensors
- Servo motor
- Battery jumper wire
- Arduino IDE for programming

## Setup and Installation
1. Assemble the hardware components according to the provided schematic.
2. Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer.
3. Upload the provided Smart Dustbin program using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage
- Place the Smart Dustbin in public areas or residential complexes.
- Ensure a power source (batteries or alternative) is available.
- Users can approach the dustbin, dispose of their garbage, and the lid will open and close automatically.
